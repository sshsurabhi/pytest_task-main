# Setup

- use your default python installation
- you have to install `pytest` in your applicable version
- running `python3 -m pytest` from the repository-root should be enough to run tests

# Tasks

1. Resolve Tests / Patch Implemenation
   - Resolve all issues until all tests are passing.
   - Each test explains the specification, assumption, task and optionally a hint.
2. Explain how logging is implemented
   - `src` implemented some logging mechanism
   - explain how it works
3. Enable test report generation
   - modify so that a report.xml (JUnit-style) is generated on a test run
   - either use pytest configurations, VS Code settings or a specific command
